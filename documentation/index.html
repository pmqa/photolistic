1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the div. The elements within this div have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

    <h2>1. Setup The Media Sizes</h2>
    <p>It is very important to setup the right media sizes, otherwise the images might not appear properly. For example, the blog posts box has a width of 640px and this means that your images' width should be less than this.</p>
    <p>Below, I have compiled a list of the <strong>recommended images sizes</strong> that are based on the Photolistic theme needs and the aspect ratio of most DSLR cameras. 
    <p>Go to <strong>Settings -> Media</strong> and insert this values: 
    <h3>Recommended Media Sizes</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>Thumbail Size = Width: 280 px : Height: 187 px</li>
        <li>Medium Size = Width: 610 px : Height: 407 px</li>
        <li>Large Size = Width: 920 px : Height: 613 px</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Use the Medium size or the Thumbnail size when inserting an image on a blog post!</em></p>
    
    <h2>2. The Home Page</h2>
    <p>The home page is made of some stuff that you can customize. These are the <a href="#changeHeader">header image</a>, <a href="#featuredBlock">the featured text block</a>, <a href="#featuredPosts">the featured posts</a> and <a href="#backgroundColor">the background color.</a></p>
    <p>The featured posts are general published posts that are in DESC order. This means that the latest post you publish will be the first one on the left side. You can also specify which specific posts you want there by stickying these posts. Read more on the featured posts section.
    <h3><a name="changeHeader">Changing the Header Image</a></h3>
    <p>First, make sure your image is width: 950 px - height: 350 px. If it isn't you must resize it and crop it on your image editor because the script doesn't automatically resizes the image.</p>
    <p>Next, simply go to Appearance -> Header and upload the image and press Save.</p>
     <h3><a name="featuredBlock">Changing the Featured Text Block</a></h3>
    <p>You can change this text on the Appearance -> Theme Options. You can also use <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">HTML links</a> so it's recommended that you use this block to write something describe what you do and to link to a contact page on your website.</p>
    <h3><a name="featuredPosts">The Homepage Featured Posts</a></h3>
    <p>These are the small posts with the thumbnail that are below the big header image. These posts are the latest posts published on your blog. The latest one is the first one on the left side. Very important, <strong>if your post doesn't have a thumbnail (set via the set_featured_image option) it'll display one of the default thumbnails that ships with Photolistic</strong>, <em>so always <a href="http://wpprobusiness.com/2036/set-featured-image-for-a-post-or-page/">set a featured image on your posts</a></em>.</p> <p>You can change the number of posts that appear here on the Appearance -> Theme Options menu. You can also specify which <strong>specific posts</strong> get there by <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/sticky-posts/">making those posts sticky.</a></p>
    <h3><a name="backgroundColor">The Background Color</a></h3>
    <p>You can change the background color at Appearance - > Background.</p>
